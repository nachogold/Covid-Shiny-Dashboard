# Covid-Shiny-Dashboard
Shiny dashboard to visualize up-to-date Covid data in different ways.

This was my first project using Shiny, made along with Felipe Moronta. The objective was to create a dashboard to quickly visualize Covid data (pulled from an online server), with the ability to choose between different chart styles.

The Shiny app was embedded in the following site to facilitate access: https://jignacio1596.wixsite.com/covid-data.
